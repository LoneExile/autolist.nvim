INSTALL                                                     *autolist-install*

Using plug:
```
Plug "gaoDean/autolist.nvim"
```

USAGE                                                         *autolist-usage*

Start an unordered list with an optional space, a dash and a space. Write the
list contents and when you're done, press enter and a new dash will be created
with a (optional space then a ) dash and a space. If you don't write anything
after the dash and the space, it will carrige return and the last empty dash
will be deleted.
	Indent lists with <c-t> (tab) and <c-d> (detab), which will indent the
whole line, not just the text after the cursor. When you detab, the dash will
not have the optional space before it, just a tab, or if it is aligned to the
very right, nothing before the dash.

Start an ordered list with an number, a dot and space, with the contents
after the space. The auto ending of the list works the same as unordered
list, when the contents is empty and you press enter, there will be a carrige
return and the last empty list entry will be deleted.
	Indenting works the same way, with the exception that this *will not*
renumber the lists, you must do it manually.

BINDINGS ~

The plugin has a one automatically generated binding:
>
	inoremap <cr> <cr>:lua require('autolist').list()<cr>
<
This just executing the list function. If it doesn't detect anything related
to the list, it does nothing.
