INSTALL                                                     *autolist-install*

Using plug:
>
	Plug "gaoDean/autolist.nvim"
<

USAGE                                                         *autolist-usage*

Start an unordered list with an optional space, a dash and a space. Write the
list contents and when you're done, press enter and a new dash will be created
with a (optional space then a ) dash and a space. If you don't write anything
after the dash and the space, it will carrige return and the last empty dash
will be deleted.

Indent lists with <c-t> (tab) and <c-d> (detab), which will indent the whole
line, not just the text after the cursor. When you detab, the dash will not
have the optional space before it, just a tab, or if it is aligned to the very
left, nothing before the dash.

Start an ordered list with an number, a dot and space, with the contents after
the space. The auto ending of the list works the same as unordered list, when
the contents is empty and you press enter, there will be a carrige return and
the last empty list entry will be deleted.

Indenting works the same way, with the exception that this *will not* renumber
the lists, you must do it manually.

BINDINGS ~

The plugin has a one automatically generated binding:
>
	inoremap <cr> <cr>:lua require('autolist').list()<cr>
<

This just executing the list function. If it doesn't detect anything related
to the list, it does nothing.

CONFIGURATION                                         *autolist-configuration*

DEFAULT OPTIONS ~

>
	local config = {
		create_enter_mapping = true,
		-- for if you have something else that you want to map when press return
		-- with the create enter being false, you must create your own mapping

		new_entry_on_o = true,
		-- when key o pressed, new list entry. Enables fo-o.

		override_fo-o = true,
		-- if you don't use formatoptions o, set this to true
		-- it will disable fo-o for all filetypes except for enabled types.

		-- if you use any of the override options, you must remove any
		-- definitions of the overrided formatoptions, or put the require setup after the formatoptions defintition.

		override_fo-r = true,
		-- if you don't use formatoptions r, set this to true
		-- it will disable fo-r for all filetypes except for enabled types.

		enabled_filetypes = { "markdown", "text" },
		-- filetypes that this plugin is enabled for
		-- must put file name, not the extension
		-- if you are not sure of the name, just run :echo &filetype
	}

Edit (part of) this table to your preferences and pass it to the `setup()`
function i.e.:

>
	require("autolist").setup({
		create_enter_mapping = true,
		new_entry_on_o = false,
		enabled_filetypes = { "markdown", "text", "other", "yaml" },
	})
